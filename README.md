# Hello, I'm Alejandro Coraspe ðŸ‘‹

Â¡Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Alejandro JosÃ© Coraspe CedeÃ±o, I'm from Venezuela and I'm currently dedicated to software development. I chose this path in my life because I was interested in technology from a young age, and when I discovered that this way you could create and interact with it, I fell in love with software development.

- ðŸŒ± My native language is Spanish. I also speak intermediate-advanced English and am currently learning Portuguese.
- ðŸ‘¯ I am looking to collaborate as a Back-End Developer on projects, as I focus on this scope. Although I don't consider myself an expert in Front-End, I can do it without any problems.
